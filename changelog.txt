V1.6.4 (11/11/25) - - - 
Adds New Maps and a Map Selection, Changes move speed to classic speed. Revive costs are now $100 with $20+ each time you die,

Maps Added Include: 
Frostbite Freeway

Version Notes:
The new maps implemented may take time on major updates like adding new collectibles etc. As they are just a seperate page instead of all being in the same one. However options will remain the same and all progress gained will still remain to work correctly. The "Map Game Version: V?.?.??" Reveals the game version last updated on that map. However the initial loaded map is always the default.
